            <blockquote>As a teacher, I strive for my students to synthesize and translate their lived experience. Through active engagement in their visual culture, I push my students to become active and engaged creators of the world around them. Iteration is essential to this growth for students. I believe the best learning, when it comes to comics, comes from doing.</blockquote>

<h4>Youth Tutoring</h4>
<p>Comics lessons can help put you or your child on the path to a lifetime of writing and drawing.</p>
<p>For beginners of all ages, my goals are simple and include basic comics composition, tool use and technique and the creation of simple rhythms and stories. A big part of my approach for all new makers is helping them to create something that they know and love early on in their experience, providing a sense of accomplishment and inspiration.</p>
<p>For intermediate and advanced makers I work to help them see that there are infinite possibilities with this supremely versatile medium. Some of my students go on to learn to self-publish via zines and mini-comics, some dive deeper into visual communication, others begin working on collaborative publishing with or on to honing their illustration skills for career oriented use.</p>

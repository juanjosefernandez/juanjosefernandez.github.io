I must be late to the game, seeing as how I just discovered the great repository of children's comics that Mykal Banta has put together. Truth be told, though, so long as I get to see these comics I'm happy to even be playing!

Here's the stellar [Big Blog of Kid's Comics.](http://www.bigblogcomics.com/search?updated-max=2012-02-09T11:54:00-05:00&max-results=2)Â Visit the site for full stories scanned at great resolutions. If you're looking to tap into the bold aesthetics of mid-century comics, I can't imagine a better inexpensive way of doing so than checking out the site that Mykal Banta curates.

Here are some covers that might catch your interest.

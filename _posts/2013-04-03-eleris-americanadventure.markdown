Here's a shout out to my classmate, [Eleri Harris](http://elerimai.com/). She's a real go getter. She's trying to raise funds to jet down to her motherland, Australia. She's doing so by selling a full run of 400 mini comics that document her forays in American Culture as an Australian cartoonist. She's nearly halfway there.

Here's a message from the cartoonist herself:


<blockquote>On June 1 my beloved friend Fifi is marrying a hippy name of Jarrah (he seems like an okay bloke) on a beach or something back home in Tasmania.

Clearly it's important for me to be there - to live draw the entire event, tell embarrassing stories about Fifi's colourful dawn of the new millennium youth and be a witness in the ceremony in a fancy frock.

**The catch? I am a broke cartoonist studying for a masters on the other side of the planet and I can't afford the airfare.**

This is where you come in. I have made 400 copies of a mini-comic called #americanadventure detailing episodes of weirdness, humour and hi-jinx in the land of the free.

**I need to sell all of them to cover my Qantas oriented debt!**

They're 16 pages, silk screen covered tiny things and they're five bucks.

Eleri's got a knack for humor and among my classmates she does some of my favorite memoir comics.

[Charles Forsman](http://charlesforsman.com/), of [Snake Oil](http://charlesforsman.com/comics/snake-oil-4/) and the [Oily Boutique](http://oilyboutique.bigcartel.com/) had a dream. It was a good dream.

Now you can find new mini-comics, support artists directly and do so with ease! That's right folks, the spirit of [Factsheet Five](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factsheet_Five) is alive, undistilled  and aimed towards comics. Thanks Charles.

If you want to be listed in the Muster-List, all you have to do is ask Charles. It's that easy.

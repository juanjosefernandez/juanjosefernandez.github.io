I thought I'd share a pairing of experiences that I've recently enjoyed combining during late night drawing, particularly when silence doesn't cut it.

My friend, [Sal Farina](http://salvatorefarina.com/index.php), has coded[ some neat visual toys ](http://salvatorefarina.com/codes.php)for Mac OS X. He's a real lover of textures and patterns. 

Of those bits of code he's written, my favorite is [_acid static_](http://salvatorefarina.com/acid.zip). Once you download and install the application, _acid static_ runs full screen behind all of your applications and on top of your desktop. Here's a screenshot of how it transforms your screen. It's truly a beautiful bit of cellular automata. (The gif doesn't do it justice, as I had to reduce it down to 5 frames...)

I combine Acid Static with [Windy and Carl](http://www.kranky.net/artists/windycarl.html)'s 1997 recording [Depths ](http://www.amazon.com/Depths-Windy-Carl/dp/B0000061I4)and I'm off to the races. I write daily comics, work out illustration compositions and in general doodle up a storm.

Here's a recent bit of inks and watercolors:[![tubular-sketch](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tubular-sketch.gif)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tubular-sketch.gif)

What kind of patterns (visual or auditory) get your mind reeling?

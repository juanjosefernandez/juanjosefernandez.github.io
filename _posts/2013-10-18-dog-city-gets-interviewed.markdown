A couple of weeks ago, [Carl Antonowicz](http://thulsadude.tumblr.com/) who writes for the [Schulz Library Blog](http://www.cartoonstudies.org/schulz/blog/) sat down with me and the Dog City boys to chat about what we’ve published in the past year as [Dog City Press.](http://www.dogcitypress.com/) The interview is now up on the blog. We talk about the editorial process, our philosophies and our aims for the future.

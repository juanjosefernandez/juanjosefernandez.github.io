Long before the internet gave niche communities their own space to share and discuss issues, ideas, and news, underground independent magazines - or ‘zines’ - were regularly written, photocopied, and distributed. Whether called ‘zines’ or not, people have been self-publishing for hundreds of years.

> The first principles of zine-making are pretty simple. Make, arrange, copy, share. If you want to make zines, I suggest you keep it simple: Paper, pen/pencil, tape/glue, photocopier/scanner, printer. Make what comes intuitively. You don't need to get fancy. What you make is going to be uniquely you and that's the joy of it.

### General Inspiration
I highly recommend this book for all things self-publishing as personal practice - **[Whatcha Mean, What's a Zine?](https://www.amazon.com/Whatcha-Mean-Whats-Esther-Watson/dp/0618563156)** by  Esther Watson and Mark Todd. It's got a great collection of varied how-tos by zine makers from the early 2000s. All the how-tos take different formats so it's fun to flip through or simply dig in. It's a nice artifact of self-publishing culture from the early '00s. Watson and Todd did a great job wrangling all the involved writers and artists. 

Here's **[video on how to make an analogue 12 page zine](https://guides.douglascollege.ca/zines/print)** by Nicki Sabalu. It's short and fun. There's lots more you can find on zines at the [Douglas College Zine Library Webstite.](https://guides.douglascollege.ca/zines)

### Comics and Cartooning Specific
Cartoonist and Educator Jessica Abel has put together a good resource on scanning and another on self-publishing that you might find interesting.  
- **[Scanning Art](https://dw-wp.com/resources/cartooning-quickguides/quickguides-scanning/)**
- **[Making Mini-Comics](https://jessicaabel.com/resources/diy/making-minicomics/)**

### Getting technical about image reproduction:
**[Re: A Guide To Reproduction](/assets/pdfs/reproguide.pdf)** This is a work that I really liked for thinking about certain things regarding technical reproduction of mini-comics. Cartoonist and illustrator [Jim Rugg talks about it in a really useful way on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiboX2iviV0).

### Finding a printer
If you have a printer at home, a photocopier at your job or library, that works! If you want to print color or large print runs, it's going to cost a lot of money. That's no good when you want to print and easily distribute your ideas. 

An affordable printer that I swear by when I print large-ish runs of my work or that of others is **[Best Value Copy](https://www.bestvaluecopy.com/)** As of today, they offer 2.7 cent b&w printing and 9 cent color printing per page! [https://www.bestvaluecopy.com/](https://www.bestvaluecopy.com/)

Hey all, I'm contributing to Tara Helfer's 72 Demons Project. I thought I'd share my work in progress.
<!--more-->

You know how I am with anthropomorphizing birds, so when I saw that Malphas, the half-man half crow defense specialist and military strategist was still up for grabs, I jumped on that. Here's a preliminary sketch fro my contribution. You can count on Malphas getting fancy.


<blockquote>[![](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/photo-43.jpg)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/photo-43.jpg)_Inspired by the Lesser Key of Solomon, comics, and 17th century grimoire, the [72DEMONS project](http://72demons.blogspot.com/) is a venue for new and budding visual artists. Our goal is to publish an illustrated book depicting the seventy-two demons archived in the Ars Goetia, believed to be a guide written by King Solomon for summoning both helpful and malevolent spirits. Thousands of years later these entities persist, although they have changed their names and faces!_
_ Since summer of 2011, [72DEMONS](http://72demons.blogspot.com/) has expanded into a diverse collective of illustrators, painters, graphic designers, writers and video artists - making for one hefty book!_</blockquote>


Here's a peek at the first proof of the beautiful book:[![](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/7312932730_2381fb28fc_b.jpeg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/68518992@N06/7312932730/in/photostream/)

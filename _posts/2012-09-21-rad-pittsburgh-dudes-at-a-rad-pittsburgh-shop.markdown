[Julie Sokolow](http://juliesokolow.com) put together a great little documentary of Jim Rugg, Jasen Lex, Tom Scioli and Ed Piskor's trip to Pittsburgh's [New Dimension Comics.](http://www.ndcomics.com)

It's well worth your time to listen to these dudes geek out over back issues.

Oh and if you haven't already checked out Jim and Jasen's podcast, [Tell Me Something I Don't Know](http://tmsidk.podbean.com), head on over to their site and check out the chit chat's they've had with artists over the past couple of months. The subject matter covers quite a broad scope, so there's sure something of use to you!

This is what I'll be living out of for the next two months in Spain: [![](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/photo-on-2011-05-05-at-16-41.jpg)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/photo-on-2011-05-05-at-16-41.jpg)I have the incredible fortune of traveling for the next two months in Spain with my girlfriend, Lena. Lena will get to fully experience a true Spain with me, completely in Spanish, we'll both get to work with cheese-making and meat curing and I will get to research a comic that I have planned.

The plan will be to arrive in Madrid to visit two family friends and then to hop on _El Ave_ to get to Zaragoza to spend a week with my grandparents. Afterwards, Lena and I will travel onwards to Catalunya to hover around Barcelona. I'll be trying to get my hands on some old copies of the anthology _[El Vibora](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_V%C3%ADbora), _which has been greatly recommended. This will be my third time in Barcelona. The first time was with my grandparents and my parents and the second was with my family, although I spent the majority of the time with my father. In our wanderings around the city I became giddy whenever we passed the many comics shops. Hell, I was getting excited by the comics selection at FNAC alone. This time, I'll be keeping my eyes out for any and all comics shops and will try to scrounge up as many unique works I can from the area. In the end I'll have to have some discretion because not only will I be traveling on the cheap, but because while the bag I'm taking with me is quite a tanker, it's got its limits.

After Barcelona, Lena and I will be headed for Huelva where we'll stay for a month working at the [Monte Robledos Queseria](http://www.monterobledo.com/). We're working on Maria Jesus' farm through WWOOF. It'll be great to be part of the cheesemaking process in my motherland. Rest assured, notes will be heavily taken and some [cheese-making](http://www.flickr.com/photos/abaceriadelsur/1428205973/) comics will surface sometime around August. All in all, we'll be working and savoring the southern Sierra for a month after which we'll set out on the road.


The last two weeks of the trip will be dedicated to hopping from town to town in the South via bus or train. We'll make our way in from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean.

On this trip I plan to devote myself to three things, taking care of Lena (and teaching her Spanish), learning how a farm is run and documenting my life in ink.

After I return, I'll spend a week in Cleveland with my parents and then will be hopping on a bus to [Buckland Farm](http://bucklandfarmcsa.com/About_Buckland_Farm.html). Some more farming, but in a climate that I'm much more accustomed to. I'll be there by myself working and learning cultivation techniques and and animal husbandry from Dan and Carrie, the owners of Buckland Farm.

Seeing as how the frequency of my future internet connectivity is unforeseen, I can't promise any posts with comments, stories or comics. Nevertheless, I can assure you that around the end of the summer, as I'm hustling to put all the pieces together for my CCS application, you'll get loads of scans of my sketchbooks.

To those of you that have supported me in my endeavors in comics, whether taking the time to look over my work, giving me tips, letting me borrow your comics or simply smiling when I got excited about images and words on paper, I owe you so much. Since I committed myself to drawing and recording through comics, I've never been happier in my life. Everyday I'm learning something new and exceeding my own expectations. I never expected this.

I'm constantly surprised by my good fortune, a loving family, an incredible best friend and girlfriend that I can travel with, a durable and rugged backpack, paper galore. To those of you that are helping me hone my craft and helping make this storytelling dream come true, thank you.

I have 10 days left until I leave. Hot damn, there's a lot to do to get ready! I have to finish my final term papers and projects (Including two clamshell boxes and a hardbound comic), move out of my current apartment, and then pack. Will I get it all done it time? Stay tuned.

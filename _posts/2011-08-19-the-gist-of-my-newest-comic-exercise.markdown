As you all know, gags aren't my thing. At least not yet. Lewis Trondheim has been a really big influence on me and his works [Mr. O](http://www.nbmpub.com/humor/trondheim/mistero/pre1.html) and [Mr. I](http://www.amazing-planet.net/slike/mister-o-and-i/mister_i_02.jpg) have gotten me to trying out my own distillations of gags strips.

The comic before you needs some touching up, but for now it captures the essence of what I wanted to do. You'll see more frames added in a bit, for now I'm getting other documents to print.Â The print version of this comic will be a mini comic that has one frame per page and that flips horizontally. It will be a radically different reading experience. In reality, that is how this comic should be read.

My self imposed deadline for applying to the CCS is looming and as such, I've got to kick myself into a higher gear. But you already knew that, didn't you?

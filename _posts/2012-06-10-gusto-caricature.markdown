My bud, Juan spins records in Pittsburgh. He's a fly dude who goes by the stage name Gusto. He's well worth your attention if you like to move your ass. I've posted him about in the past, but I thought I'd bring him up again.

I was listening to one of his mixes and got inspired to do a little caricature of him. I thought I'd share. Did I mention he's a cutie?

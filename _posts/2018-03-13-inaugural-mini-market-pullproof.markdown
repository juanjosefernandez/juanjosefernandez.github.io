![PULLPROOF Studios - mini-market](https://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/unnamed.gif)

The weekend before last I sold and shared comics during the Penn Avenue _Unblurred _gallery crawl. I set up shop at PULLPROOF Studio's inaugural Mini-Market. All in all, it featured zines, prints, and jewelry by a local crew of great artists. It was really nice company. Among us were [Jenna Houston](https://studio.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a15f9ef9b5110e39e5b52b696&id=ec608b3b72&e=51ebdeb0bb), [Lizzee Solomon](https://studio.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a15f9ef9b5110e39e5b52b696&id=7bfb56e495&e=51ebdeb0bb), [City Slicker Press](https://studio.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a15f9ef9b5110e39e5b52b696&id=aa0917bf4e&e=51ebdeb0bb), [Max Emiliano Gonzales](https://studio.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a15f9ef9b5110e39e5b52b696&id=66b70fc7e1&e=51ebdeb0bb), [Jerome "Chu" Charles](https://studio.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a15f9ef9b5110e39e5b52b696&id=d9e31dfbce&e=51ebdeb0bb), Asia Lae, Lilian Kababa!

[PULLPROOF Studio](https://studio.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a15f9ef9b5110e39e5b52b696&id=9ad575d1ff&e=51ebdeb0bb) is an in-progress printmaking studio in Pittsburgh, PA. They intend to offer a fully equipped silkscreen printing facility with a shared workspace and small storefront gallery at [5112 Penn Avenue](https://maps.google.com/?q=5112+Penn+Avenue&entry=gmail&source=g) in the Garfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Their mission is to provide affordable access to silkscreen printing equipment, space, and time to artists in the Western Pennsylvania area. It's going to be nice to have them in addition to the Artists Image Resource on the North Side._

I did my best Frank Santoro/Bill Boichel impersonation and brought comics to the people. Frank loaned me a stash of Colombian comics from when he'd been invited to [Entreviñetas](http://www.entrevinetas.com/) in 2014. It was nice to sell those and see them make their way into the hands of Pittsburghers.

I've been collecting and curating a wide array of zines and comics that express the vision of visual literacy that I'd like to see more of in the world. Among those collected comics, I also sell comics that I've helped produce, my own and those of the Pittsburgh Comics Salon. It's a healthy mix.

I like to make it concretely clear to people, through in-person experience, that, yes, whatever you're into, there's a comic or zine you're going to love. It's nice to proselytize as a vendor, not just an educator or artist. I'll be setting up shop with this set around town some more in the coming months, so keep your eyes peeled. test

A huge thank you to PULLPROOF, Christina Lee in specific, for inviting me and hosting this event. This is the kind of selling and sharing of comics and culture I want to see more of in Pittsburgh.

_Daunted and Freed by the Script_

Every month I've been putting together a recap of the Comics Salon happenings for supporters of the[ Comics Salon Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pittsburghcomicssalon?ty=h). I'd like to start sharing those thoughts here with you. Let me know what you think, comes to mind while you read in the comments. If you'd like to support the ongoing efforts of the Pittsburgh Comics Salon, [take a look at the Patreon page I've set up. ](https://www.patreon.com/pittsburghcomicssalon?ty=h)Be a patron of the arts in Pittsburgh, whydontcha?

_The goal of the salon is to build solidarity, get new conversations started between cartoonists and comics makers in the area and to push the frontiers of comics making in an intimate and welcoming setting here in Pittsburgh, PA._

August saw [Allison Strejlau](http://cargocollective.com/astrejlau), take the floor to lead an exercise in the handling of translating a tight comedy script to rough pencils. Allison has been the series illustrator for [Boom!Studios](http://www.boom-studios.com/)' Regular Show comics and illustrates for Papercutz' Nickelodeon Magazine Breadwinners series, and has had work with the Adventure Time and Uncle Grandpa comics from [KaBoom!Studios](http://www.kaboom-studios.com/). Oof, has she got comedy and narrative chops! The idea here was to give local comics makers a very structured comics prompt where they were primarily encouraged to flex their visual sequencing muscle.

The structure that one usually gets when working a work-for-hire artist can be daunting and hard to describe. Nevertheless for some cartoonists this can be an extremely freeing comics making opportunity. The "what" of the comic is already determined by the writers. The comics maker then gets to focus exclusively on the "how" of the comic. We wanted the Salon to have experience with this mode of creation.

The page that was handled happened to be the page that Allison had to draw when she applied to the open call to be the main artist on the series for BOOM! Comics.

Allison explained the demeanors of the characters Rigby and Muscle Man but did not give away what the characters looked like in the series. As a result, the characters look similar, but vastly different from page to page. It was funny to see everyone's reaction when Allison revealed that Rigby was a racoon!

The nuts and bolts of this exercise revolved around how the panels would sit on the comics page. How many panels in the first tier? How about the second and third tiers? Seven panels on a page provided an interesting challenge in that it asked the tiers of the page to have unequal numbers of panels. The meter of the page would therefore have to deal with that AND be sure to provide a good rhythm for the visual gags.![](http://i.imgur.com/3xR1iQV.png)

This was Allison's final page. For BOOM!

Be sure to compare the convergences between the pages made during the Salon and Allison's inks. Take note of where comics makers put the three tiers and which tiers they clumped together. What effect does that have on the reading experience? What differences do you notice from comic to comic?

Needless to say, a great time was had.![](http://i.imgur.com/KjVLWYm.jpg)

P.S. Check out these pages made with children using the same script. The children who made these pages were aware of what the characters looked like.

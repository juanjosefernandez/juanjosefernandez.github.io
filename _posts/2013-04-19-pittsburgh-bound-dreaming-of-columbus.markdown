I'm Pittsburgh bound, but I have pangs to be in Columbus. At the Billy Ireland Library and Museum, more precisely. Man, what a spiritual place...

Julie Sokolow recently produced a [short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu0cCTZvaVw) that explores that Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum at Ohio State University. Watch the [Tell Me Something I Don't Know](https://twitter.com/TMSIDKS) crew geek out over Nancy panels with librarian, Caitlin Mcgurk.

Speaking of spiritual places, I'm off to go to Pittsburgh real soon. I have the first edition of my first Dailies collection. I'm damn proud of my babies. I'm looking to give them out to all the good folks that have helped me out Â in my cartooning endeavors and then to sell a couple. Hope folks in the 'burgh like 'em!

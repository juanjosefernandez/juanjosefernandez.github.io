I'm busy, but you deserve a post, dear reader.

Check out Charles Burns speaking at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

I've always liked seeing what material Burns apes and seeing how he transforms it. My vision of Burns envisions him as a classic 20th century cartoonist whose processes are so fixed, that when presented with his work, it's always obvious that he has created the image. Some people argue that he's a one trick pony, but to those I say that they're not looking closely enough at what he's doing with traditional american imagery.

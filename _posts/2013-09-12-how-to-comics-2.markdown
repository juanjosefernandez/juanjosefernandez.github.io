This is your second lesson.




Grab some index cards. Don't got no index cards? Grab some post-it notes.We're doing six panel comics today. this is what they'll look like.

An important note: More likely than not, your comics today won't be anything to write home about. **That's okay, that's not the point. **

**Do the following in light pencil.**

-Write the name of the last person that you spoke to on the phone with on one of the cards.
-Think of the year 1970. Write down some words to describe the images that you see in your mind on the second card.
- Draw a circle or a square in the third box.
- Draw your non-dominant hand in the 4th panel.
- Draw two human silhouettes facing each other in the 5th box.
- Write a four letter word in the last Box.
Turn the panels face down and mix them up in a pile. Flip them over and arrange them in a new order. Let chance determine this order.

**Time for an intermission.**

Grab a ballpoint pen or some crummy writing utensil.
Grab 6 new notecards or post its. Make 4 marks on each. Circles, squares, diagonals, spirals. It's all good. Turn them all over. You will now turn them face up one at a time. What do you see? Draw the rest of what you see. If you don't see anything yet, add some more random marks one at a time. Wait for it to click. Eventually you'll have made 6 doodles. Great job.




**Time for the second act.**

Turn on some good instrumental music and connect the panels!




I suggest you draw in pen this time around. Feel free to erase what you need to from the original pencils in order to make this comic read relatively clearly. Add word balloons if you like. Perhaps a character? It's your comic after all. Try to keep traces of the original ideas in each panel.

Have fun, pal.

**I'm excited to see what you make! **

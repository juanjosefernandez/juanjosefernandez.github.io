Not comics, but I did make this self portrait. This photo ain't a half bad way to be remembered by. Taken with a timer in the summer of 2008 by the Diamond Lakes in the Sierra Nevada  using my ma's SLR, developed at a CVS in Chagrin Falls with Katherine Wolf.[![](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/juanfield.jpg)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/juanfield.jpg)

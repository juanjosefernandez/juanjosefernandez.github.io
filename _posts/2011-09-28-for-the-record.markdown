Not comics, but I did take this self portrait 3 years ago. I love it.

This photo ain't a half bad way to be remembered by. Taken with a timer in the summer of 2008 by the Diamond Lakes in the Sierra Nevada  using my mami's SLR, developed at a CVS in Chagrin Falls with Katherine Wolf.[![](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/juanfield.jpg)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/juanfield.jpg)

In the works is a new comic done at a scale unprecedented for me. There will be a total of 12 frames, 2 huge, 2 skinny horizontal strips and 8 standard rectangles.

Devoid of any words, it is a vignette of my creative process and the birth of a new character, Birdman. This has been an exercise in exploring contour line drawing from life. I'll have some images up for you soon. I just wanted to announce the coming images.

On another note, the CCS sneaking changed the requirements for their application comic. Not too much changed, I've got all of he bases covered excluding a non English speaking character. Time to work that in there somehow...

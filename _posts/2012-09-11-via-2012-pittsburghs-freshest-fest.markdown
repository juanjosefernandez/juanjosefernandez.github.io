VIA 2012 is coming up on the horizon! A festival that's just as much a tech and culture laboratory, VIA's bringing talented folks from around the world to do what they do best for a whole week. From workshops, performances, interactive art, dance free-for-alls, VIA has been the root of some of my greatest experiences in Pittsburgh.

Almost finished with the semester.

You can count on drawings to be posted soon. For now, let's bask in the vivaciousness of the following two animations by Norman Mclaren and Evelyn Lambart.

The following animation and its accompanying audio were both created by hand by painting and scratching the film.

Albert Ammons and Norman Mclaren team up to create this "boogie doodle"

then there's the Oscar Peterson Trio's work animated by Mclaren and Lambart.

And in a more contemporary note. You should check out Cyriak's 2010 video "Cycles". It's a fun experimental video done digitally.

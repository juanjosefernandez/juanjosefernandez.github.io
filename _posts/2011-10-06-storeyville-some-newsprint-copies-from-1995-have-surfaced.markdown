A year ago I read Storeyville by Frank Santoro and it was an experience like no other. I read the hardcover copy that was available at the Toonseum and the delicate combination of hope and melancholy of the whole work stayed with me for weeks.

I just read some exciting news over at the comics journal. Some copies of sealed Storeyville's were found here in Pittsburgh. Awesome.[ Be sure to check out this awesome find and to pick up a copy if you can.](http://www.copaceticcomics.com/comics/1343)

This thing is a real collectors item that is sure to stir the spirit of the Pittsburgher in all of us.

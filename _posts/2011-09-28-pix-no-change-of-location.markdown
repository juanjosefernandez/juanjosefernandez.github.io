<blockquote>PIX HAS BOOMERANGED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL LOCATION AT 2839 LIBERTY AVENUE IN THE STRIP DISTRICT! (Google Map: http://g.co/maps/8s292 ) IN OTHER WORDS, PLEASE IGNORE OUR PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT A NEW LOCATION. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE. JUST ERASE IT FROM YOUR MIND AND PRETEND YOU NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT. PIX IS PROCEEDING AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED.</blockquote>


Just making sure to keep you posted!

As an aside, my application for the Center for Cartoon Studies is in. Let's see where things go from here. I'll keep you posted.

Here's a peek at the ink that's been flowing recently. As you can tell, Joann Sfar has been big on my mind recently.

So what's new with me? Well, I recently picked up an illustration gig here in the Upper Valley. I can't talk too much about it yet, but I'll let you know how it pans out. There's a pretty quick turn around on the project, so I should be able to share that with you soon.

Besides that, I'm currently working on 3 stories for an anthology project here at CCS. The anthology that I'm working on with my fellow students revolves around a time travelling delivery service. Each of the stories will be about the delivery of a particular item that plays an important role in the course of history. No fancy time logic here, just a simple premise and solid, whole hearted storytelling. 

I'm looking to have the stories done by early December, one revolves around[ Yves Klein](http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/), another around [Shodo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calligraphy), and another around [chinese latticework](http://www.smartdecorprops.com.au/blog/chinese-lattice/). I've really been enjoying researching the three. I'm excited to what the sum of our efforts together is going to allow for us to create, especially the packaging.

Finally, as usual, I want to share some music with you. Earlier this week I came across the following video that juxtaposes Stan Brakhage's experimental silent films, [Dog Star Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Star_Man), with Boards of Canada's [Music Has the Right To Children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Has_the_Right_to_Children). There are some really nice moments of synchronicity. Makes for some really nice background noise visually and musically while drawing.

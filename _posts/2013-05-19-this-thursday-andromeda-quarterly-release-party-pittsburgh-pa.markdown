For those of you in or near Pittsburgh, PA next week:

Come join the [Andromeda Quarterly](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Andromeda-Quarterly/122087897831664) this Thursday, the 23rd from 6pm to 8pm at the [Copacetic Comics Co.](http://www.copaceticcomics.com/) for an evening of celebrating Pittsburgh’s own Rustbelt Comics Anthology. [Click here for more event details.](https://www.facebook.com/events/338125096314296/)

The publication is now on Issue 3 and I've got a couple of comics in the issue. Come check it out, talk comics and meet some of the contributors in person. They’d love to have you.

The new issue will be for sale as well as past Quarterly and Monthly issues. If you’re interested in submitting you’ll have a chance to talk to the editors and get advice/feedback on your work.

I’ll be there. Hope you can make it!

(Of course, if you can’t make it, you can [order a copy online!](http://littletired.storenvy.com/products/1548851-andromeda-quarterly-issue-3) )

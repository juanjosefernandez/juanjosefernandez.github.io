Here's some quick, Bleck inspired movement. Nothing fancy.

The cinematographic effect is pretty simple: Hover then zoom. I'm wrapping up my time at Carnegie Mellon , so I'm tied up with many a things, but know, good readers, that when I want a break and something optimistic to think about, I think about what cool things I can share with you! Thought I'd share this little playful bit.

I'll likely be adding some color to this and spicing it up. I'll use a Joost Swarte style palette of pastels.

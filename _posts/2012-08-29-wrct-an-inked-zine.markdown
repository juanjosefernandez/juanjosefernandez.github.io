gettin' there. now I've got to get it into a printer friendly mode so that my good friends in pittsburgh can print, staple and distribute.  I'll have some photos of it being distributed sometime soon. For now, enjoy the meat and potatoes of it...

The kind folks at WRCT took some photos from their recent orientation event and sent some my way. Gotta say that it gives me an immense amount of joy to see these little guys being put to use in the hands of folks interested in the station.

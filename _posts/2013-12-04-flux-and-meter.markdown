Behold, the poster for my thesis at the Center for Cartoon Studies. Hope you dig it.

In the coming months I’ll be posting loads of new 4 panel comics. For the moment, though I’m keeping to myself a little bit.

I’m trying to create a buffer between the work and the public eye.

The internet is weird and though I’m tempted to publish my comics immediately, I’m going to be spending more time with these dailies before you get to see them. It’s for the best.

I think you’re going to like the comics that I have up my sleeve.

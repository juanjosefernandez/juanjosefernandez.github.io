The Pittsburgh 'Zine fair is coming up real soon. Are you stoked?

Before that, there's a little benefit being put together to help sponsor the event. If you can't wait to meet other self-publishing cartoonists, poets, journalists and prose writers, check 'em all out at the Zine Fair Benefit on August 24th at the Mr. Roboto Project on Penn Avenue in Pittsburgh.


Be sure to check it out if you're looking for some homegrown Pittsburgh culture.

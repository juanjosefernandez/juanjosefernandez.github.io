Just something I thought I'd share. Drawn by Laura in 1984, ain't it a beauty?

Unknown to most anglophones (and even many Spaniards), [Laura Pérez Vernetti](http://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/perez-vernetti_laura.htm) is a spanish illustrator from Barcelona that contributed regularly to the underground Spanish comics magazine, el Víbora, from 1981 until 1991. Her work is distanced from standard aesthetics and conventional narratives, focusing primarily on comics that deal head on with themes of erotica, experimental forms, and socio-politcal commentary(the Spanish Civil War in particular). Additionally, she has adapted the works of Maupassant, De Quicey, Jung and Kafka to comics.

Most recently she put out an homage to the Portuguese poet, Pessoa. A biography and adaptation of his poems and prose, she published '[Pessoa & Cia](http://lucesdegalibo.blogspot.com/2012/01/pessoa-cia.html)' in December 2011 through [Luces de Gálibo](http://www.lucesdegalibo.com/). Those spanish speakers among you, interested in learning more about this book, which she both wrote and illustrated can check out [the short that RTVE aired in January of 2012](http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20120124/laura-perez-vernetti-adapta-poesia-fernando-pessoa-comic/491952.shtml), along with the article written by Jésus Jiménez.

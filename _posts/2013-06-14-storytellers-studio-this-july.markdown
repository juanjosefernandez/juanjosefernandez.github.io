[![Finalstorytellers](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/finalstorytellers.gif?w=590)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/finalstorytellers.gif)Hey Pittsburghers!

Do you know any kids ages 5-13 who love writing and sharing stories? They might love to participate in **Storytellers’ Studio: After-Camp Care!**

Over the course of this five-day program, kids get to collaborate with other campers on a group story and adapt it into** plays, songs/raps, and comics**. I’ll be facilitating the comics making. I'm really excited to be part of this program and can't wait to see what we all cook up comics-wise!

[For more information about the program, visit the Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/544484665616031/?notif_t=plan_user_invited).

If you know somebody who might be interested in this, I'd love for you to pass this along their way.

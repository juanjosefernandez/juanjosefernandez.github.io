I'm just about wrapped up for the Fall Semester at Carnegie Mellon. Lots of work to complete before I go home, so for now all I've really got is link that you, my good reader, might enjoy.

Here's a link to an image blog dedicated to the appreciation of the 4 color process of comics and the striking images that this analogue process creates combined with the artistic visions of the cartoonists who put them down into ink.

[Here,](http://4cp.posterous.com/in-defense-of-dots-the-lost-art-of-comic-book) Half-Man Half Static waxes a bit of poetic on the allure and power of these images.
The regularly updated blog is found [here.](http://4cp.posterous.com/)

Additionally, here's [Supertype](http://supertype.posterous.com/), Half Man Half Static's solid little collection of high resolution titles from comic book covers. I see it as a good potential resource for lettering inspiration.

I've been drawing a bunch recently, but no story pictures. Sorry y'all, I'm too busy for that right now.

Here's a preview of what you can check out at 4CP.


<blockquote>The mossy green on the top two-thirds of this image is a single, uniform, printed color. The darker areas and ghostly gutters and speech balloon come from the opposite side of the paper. When you're on the lefthand page of a comic, this is the palimpsest effect; if you're on the righthand page, it's foreshadowing.</blockquote>

And now, some recent sketches and doodles. The grid was inspired by [Ivan Brunetti's Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice](http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300170993). It's a combination of "The Eyebrow Transition" and the "forced grid practice". I got bored with the "Eyebrow transition so mixed it up while still focusing and honing the control of emotion via the eyehrows.

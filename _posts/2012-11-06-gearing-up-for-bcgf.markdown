The eagerness of the sun to set nowadays is really hitting me hard. Given that the early dusk causes me to naturally feel down and generally drowsy, I'm fighting pretty hard to stay productive and on top of things. Slowly but surely things are getting done.

Just on the horizon, fueling my cartooning fires, is the [Brooklyn Comics and Graphics Festival](http://www.comicsandgraphicsfest.com/). Tomorrow I'll be putting these copies of On They Bicker Together so as to have something to hand out and trade with the nice folks that I come across. Being as particular as I am about my comics, I'm actually thinking of re-lettering the comic on velum on a rainy day, but that's for another post.

There are so many folks on the exhibitors list that I've never heard of, but given that they're in the company of Jordan Crane, Hellen Jo, Jon Vermilyea, Jen Tong and Jon Pham, I can't express how excited I am to be in their company. I'll be sure to document my experience there to share with you.

[There are going to be panels galore ](http://www.comicsandgraphicsfest.com/2012-programming/)and unlike SPX, I won't have to miss a single one of them.

I'm also stoked to see what [dw](http://www.kidclampdown.com/about) has been up to. dw does some truly rad cartooning. Cogent psychedoolia that is a visceral energy laden feast for the eyes. He has a book entitled, Abzernad, coming out through [Hic & Hoc Publications](http://hicandhoc.storenvy.com/). I caught glances of the last few pages that he was working on for the book this summer and boy are they juicy!

To accompany the panels, and gallery openings and meet-n-greets in shops and bars, there're are going to be screenings of some truly awesome material.

<blockquote>Selections from the 2012 Eyeworks Festival of Experimental Animation
Curated by Lilli Carré and Alexander Stewart

Originating in Chicago, Eyeworks Festival of Experimental Animation focuses on abstract animation and unconventional character animation. Now in its third year, the festival showcases outstanding contemporary and classic experimental animation of all sorts, with films created by hand-drawn, computer, and stop-motion techniques. This 80 minute program of selections from the Eyeworks Festival has been specially curated for the Brooklyn Comics and Graphics Festival.</blockquote>


Besides all of the comics festivities that I'll be engaging in, I'll be visiting two close friends of mine who I met in France, Tim who lit the flame of comics appreciation in my little heart and Katherine who helped developed my a sensitivity towards aesthetics. Be still my beating heart, for we shall eat blueberry pancakes and Scoobydoos in plentitude.

This is going to be one hell of a weekend.

In other news, the following is the sound of my November nights in Vermont. Enjoy and be kind.

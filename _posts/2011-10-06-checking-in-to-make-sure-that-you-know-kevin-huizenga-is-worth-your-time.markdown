Folks, I'm bogged down by linguistics classes, managing WRCT and printing and binding work for PIX, but I don't want the week to pass by without speaking to you. As such, I'll point you in the direction of 3 interesting and inspiring things.
<!--more-->

1) Time Travelling by Kevin Huizenga is a story worth experiencing. It appeared in the original Ganges and I find it beautifully done. http://whatthingsdo.com/comic/time-travelling/

2) Rob Clough just did a solid write up that covers Michael Deforge's comics and illustration work over the past four years over at the comics journal. If you've got a bit of time, head on over and introduce yourself to Deforge's work if you haven't done so already.

3) William Kentridge's ["Automatic Writing"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmvK7A84dlk)

Oh and if you're looking for a good time on Tuesday nights, tune into WRCT Pittsburgh for my showÂ [Juan on Juan](http://www.wrct.org/show/599/). I cohost it with my great friend Juan Lafontaine, but he doesn't show up until the last 15 minutes to play some tightly rerubbed disco. I tend to play 60's soul and ambient electronic of the Japanese variety. It's a blessing to be able to such a fun show with such a fun loving guy. Call the request line and I'd love to talk to you.

Show the Pittsburgh cartooning scene some love and help  make Nate McDonough's graphic novel Don't Come Back a reality.

He's done all the work, he just needs to print these bad boys. Of course, before he does so, he needs to know these comics will be going to good homes. Won't you take one in as your own?

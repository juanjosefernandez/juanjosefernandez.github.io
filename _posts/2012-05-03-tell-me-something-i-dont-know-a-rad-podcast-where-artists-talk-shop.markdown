How does an artist make a living? What compromises does an artist make? Is the idea of the "sell out" obsolete? How have the technologies of the past 20 years made it possible to be an artist? What does it mean for a city to have a good creative culture. What do you do when offered the opportunity to script an opera?

Artist, if these are questions that keep you up at night, read on.

[Jim Rugg](jimrugg.com) and [Jasen Lex](awefulbooks.com.), two fine artists in their own right, host a great podcast that I've been listening to recently. More often than not the discussions shed light on the artistic growth of the interviewed artists. Given the breadth and quality of many of the interviewed artist's work, it's a hell of a satisfying listen. The inspiring thing about this podcast is that it's ripe with ideas and tips from folks who are eking out artistic lives, making the rules along the way.

So far, Rugg and Lex have chatted with Wayne Wise, Cecil Castelluci, Farel Dalrymple, and Tom Scioli.Â [Have a listen while you ink.](http://tmsidk.podbean.com/)

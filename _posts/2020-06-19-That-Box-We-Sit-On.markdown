That Box We Sit On by Richie Pope is a little comics miracle. This comic, much like LINK*Super Itis* and LINK*Fatherson*, is a testament to the power of Richie Pope‚Äôs imagination. 

*I want to pop open the hood and take a look at what I see going on in this excellent short story.*

This comics gem consists of two friends musing about the (electric transformer) box that they‚Äôve come to sit on every day after school for 16 pages. Their theories about it are wild, ranging from a mech slumbering underground or a spatial portal to a sub-dimension to more creepy and silly origin stories. 

This comic is like shooting the breeze with your good bud. You rag on each other, but it‚Äôs all good. You don‚Äôt have anywhere to be or anything to do. So your imagination runs wild while staying super chill. 
This comic is a breath of fresh air.

When I found this comic in 2018, I found myself in awe of Pope‚Äôs control as a storyteller.  With the bare minimum, black lines on white paper, his work shows an unparalleled strength of imagination and an brilliant intellectual thoroughness. Top to bottom, every panel counts. All killer, no filler.

Aesthetically Pope plays with the power of yin and yang. 

Like Taiyo Matsumoto‚Äôs Kuro and Shiro in Tekkon Kinkreet, there's beautiful tension of a runaway imagination with a stable, consistenlty chill realness. The character designs make their silhouettes instantly recognizeable. Think Aaron McGruder‚Äôs Huey and Riley from, Boondocks, turned down a couple knobs. Hypothesis vs. counterhypothesis. Question vs. Answer. Thesis. Antithesis.

Each of the comic‚Äôs sixteen pages contains a single six panel grid. No variance. Using such a prescriptive structure, the work achieves a meditative quality that at once feels tense but supple. Despite the tight structure, it never drones on.

An interesting side-effect of his techinique is that as a reader I find myself asking: Where does this box begin and end? The act of reading becomes a multidimensional experience, where each hypothetical timeline becomes one of many faces on a hypercube. Damn. I applaud Pope for using comics formalism to allow the form of the comic to dance so beautifully in unison with the form of the subject.

<div class="box"></div>

The down-to-earth, natural, genuine feel of the comic cannot be understated. Pope‚Äôs dialogue sounds simple and fresh. Expertly written and playfully lettered.

Pope‚Äôs even handed uniform line allows him to emphasize his spot blacks over any particularly sexy lines. Cartooning in this way allows him to build a visual shorthand throughout this comic and it allows the lines that form the box they sit on to blend, naturally, with the lines that compose the grid. I'm a huge fan of lettering that is an extension of the way that the rest of the page is rendered. It all is of a piece, woven to feel like a cohesive feeling song.

## Structural Breakdown: ##
Here's how I conceive of breaking down the pages and spreads as conceptual units. More than a mere exercise in pedantry, I'd like to outline the structure of this comic because doing so speaks to what a uniquely and discretely structured bit of comics Pope has concocted!

## üì¶ What is it? ##
(1 Page) 
## üì¶ What it is.  ##
(6 pages)
One page postulations‚Ä¶ 6 postulations, 6 sides of the box. I love that this sequence can be seen as a narrative cube embedded within the story. 
1. Mech
2. Bug
3. Black World
4. Portal
5. Aging
6. Milk

### üì¶ 1 ‚Äì¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Dog‚Äù  ###
(2 pages)
### üì¶ 2 ‚Äì¬†‚ÄúTiny room containing room within rooms.‚Äù  ###
(2 pages)
### üì¶ 3 ‚Äì PAUSE  ### 
(2 pages) I think the inclusion of this spread is essential in that it allows the reader to feel the space as time, a reminder of the medium of comics and a reminder of the nature of the infinite possibilities of imagination, and the box. It‚Äôs the space within the cube.

This sequence presents the present as the experience of infinity, we find ourselves VIVIDLY in the many hypothetical embedded realities

## üì¶ It is what it is. ##
(2 pages) he crashes it all into a flat possibility, as flat as the page you are reading

## üì¶ Is it?  ##
(1 page) this echoes out the infinite, as you close this book, this reality you ask, is my world just a page in someone‚Äôs comic? just a potential parallel reality? FORMAL TRIUMPH - 
<div class="box"></div>

Needless to say I love this comic. I teach this comic when I work with teens. I teach this comic when I work with adults. 

It‚Äôs a big deal to see Black kids just shooting the breeze in comics. Inevitably, the politics of allowing your Black characters to hang out and just joke around and eat sunflower seeds is a big deal. Though they‚Äôre not being heavily policed, or harmed in the comic the threat of being threatened by armed police is still present. Needless, to say it‚Äôs really satisfying to see Black boys afforded some simplicity, a chance to be goofy and carefree in comic.

The reason why I recommend That Box We Sit On¬†onto others, why I'm still writing and thinking about it 2 years after I bought it from Richie is that it's bit of comics magic.  It does what only art can do:

> You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You‚Äôre moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You‚Äôve just crossed over into‚Ä¶ the Twilight Zone.

***That Box We Sit On*** is a testament to Richie‚Äôs imagination, improvisation, and craft. While the characters never physically leave the spot they‚Äôre at, they take us across space and time, six panels at a time. The work stays fresh as you never pin down what the "box" is. Grounded and clever + abstract and expansive. This work is impossibly full of joy and it begs to be shared. 

Quietly glorious in terms of form, content and how it speaks in the context of contemporary America ‚Äì a comics miracle indeed. üì¶

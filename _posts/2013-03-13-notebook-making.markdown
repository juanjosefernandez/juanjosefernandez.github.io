A notebook that fits in your breast pocket is a thing of beauty.

Comprised of no more than a durable cover with a neat image and and some quality graph paper, a small notebook helps me create an unparalleled connection to the world around me. It lets be in the moment.

I was recently approached by [WRCT Pittsburgh](http://www.wrct.org/) to produce a small run of notebooks for their journalists to use during their 2013 coverage of the SXSW Festival in Austin. It was a pleasure to make them a custom screen printed design for the occasion.

If you are interested in ordering some custom notebooks, let me know. I'd love to work with you in designing a small runs of notebooks for you and your crew.

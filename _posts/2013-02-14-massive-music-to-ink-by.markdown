WRCT Pittsburgh, [my radio alma mater](http://www.wrct.org/), is putting together their annual Massive Music Weekend broadcast. The fine folks at 88.3 FM will be curating 120 30 minute blocks of the finest musical selections that they can get their greasy paws on.

I highly recommend [tuning in online and live streaming ](http://stream.wrct.org:8000/wrct-hi.mp3) the broadcast this weekend at some point. It's a great way to get an immersive dip into the many worlds of pioneering musicians. It's a weekend like no other at WRCT that culminates in a live musical(see:noise) performance by the stations many volunteers.

AND as with all fine music, you've got to have your fine prints. The ladies at WRCT know what's up.

Today I finished up a little page to celebrate the upcoming [Pittsburgh Zine Fair on September 22nd](http://pghzinefair.com/). Thought I'd share with y'all.

If all goes well, this'll be the back cover for the program guide for the event. I've never hand lettered to this degree, so it was a satisfying exploration. This isn't the best scan, but it'll do for now.

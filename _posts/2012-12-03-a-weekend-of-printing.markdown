I would be lying to you if I told you I wasn't pooped.

The semester is coming to a close here at the Center for Cartoon Studies and that means that the First Year Anthology Deadline is rearing its little old head up on the horizon. As such, I've spent the past days this weekend screen printing a good number of covers for an upcoming project. No drawing, no writing, just printing and trouble shooting(lots of that!).

Alongside 3 partners, I'm creating 11 little booklets that will be bound together by a bellyband (that'll be a wearable "communicator"). You can see some of the covers below.

As mentioned in earlier posts, each of the stories will work together to create the notion of a Time Travelling Parcel Service, that is, the **TPS**. Each story is thus the delivery of an important object in history. The deliveries range from Abraham Lincoln's top hat to a water bottle to the last human being on earth. It's been enormously interesting to see how much this project has slowly changed from the onset.

We began with the idea that the anthology would be a collection of facsimile objects that a traveler who was unstuck in time would carry around. There would be napkins with messages, letters, sketchbooks, but we found cohesion across narratives to be difficult achieve. Details on that and a future iteration of that are for a later date...

Until our next encounter on the internet, friend, I leave you with a few winter themed drawings I did during a little drawing party at CCS, along with the sweet sounds of Air's Talisman.

[![I'll be there. Will you?](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pix2011poster4large.jpg)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pix2011poster4large.jpg)I'll be there as a vendor. Be sure to check out my wares. The venue, the Guardian Storage Facility is the most breath taking location for a Comics Expo you could ask for. Bring a friend or two because it's going to be even more grand than last year.  I'll keep you all posted on guests and things along those lines.

Here you go, as promised. My most recent comic, Bü's Mansion - Lionel and the Punks. This is the longest continuous narrative that I've done since last year's Rinfon and it feels really good to have done and to have it look as nice and crisp as it does. I'm printing this mini on a creamy off white and it's looking fantastic. I'm currently trying to figure out how to package it. I still don't know how to silk screen so that's not an option. Nevertheless, I'm thinking of hand cut decorations on coverstock that is off a heavier grade. I'd love to sell these for a dollar, because I know that people will actually buy them. Nevertheless, $2 for a mini comic of this hand crafted flavor doesn't seem too steep. Any more, though and it seems unreasonable. Hell, I'd have a hard time paying $3 for this.

The pricing issue is a weird one, isn't it? I feel excited to cough over $2 and feel like I'm making out with a great deal, while for $3 I feel like I'm missing something. And yet for $1 I feel like what I'm getting isn't worth anything. Maybe I just don't know how to quantify money in qualitative terms well enough...

**NOTA BENE: Below are the spreads, therefore read horizontally until the middle of the spread and then move downwards.**[![](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/bc3bc-web.jpg)](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/bc3bc-web.jpg)

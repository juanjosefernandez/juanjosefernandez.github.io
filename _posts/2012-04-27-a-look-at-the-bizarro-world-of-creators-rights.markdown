Chris Roberson, the co-creator of the DC comic, i-Zombie [speaks to Tim Hodler at TCJ](http://www.tcj.com/i-have-not-yet-had-any-conversation-with-any-creator-who-doesnt-agree-with-what-ive-said-an-interview-with-chris-roberson/) about his recent departure from DC and his first hand experiences with the ugly nature of DC's intellectual property practices when it comes to creator's rights.

<blockquote>_Last week, Chris Roberson, a novelist and publisher who has worked on several comics titles for DC and Vertigo, including his own co-creation_iZombie_, [announced via Twitter](http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/04/19/chris-roberson-quits-dc-comics/) that due to ethical concerns, he was no longer comfortable working for DC Comics. The remarks, following in the wake of several other comics-related controversies (_Before Watchmen _and general disappointment over the handling of Jack Kirby’s legacy, among numerous other things) very quickly spread throughout the comics internet, and shortly led to [DC terminating Roberson’s contract](http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/04/20/chris-roberson-fired-dc-comics/). Roberson’s public statements, and the sometimes fiery arguments that they have provoked, seemed in some way to augur a possible modest paradigm shift, and we were very pleased when he agreed to speak to us about what happened, his relationship with DC, and the ethics of the comics industry._</blockquote>


Obviously, the recently announced Before Watchmen is mentioned, so get ready to have a bad taste in your mouth.

The comments are ripe with discussion, [so check it out.](http://www.tcj.com/i-have-not-yet-had-any-conversation-with-any-creator-who-doesnt-agree-with-what-ive-said-an-interview-with-chris-roberson/)

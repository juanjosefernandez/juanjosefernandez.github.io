Seein' as how I shared some illustrations for the paper, I thought I'd share with you this is the cover I did for the Tartan's arts and culture magazine, Pillbox. It captured the feel of the traditional notion of Carnegie Mellon Universities Carnival pretty well. This was a pretty politically correct cover. It came out nicely on newsprint, full of energy, but not too noisy.

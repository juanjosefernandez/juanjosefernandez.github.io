Over the past couple of months, while not cranking out my daily comics here at the Center for Cartoon Studies, I've been working hard alongside my buds, [Luke Healy](http://lukewhealy.com/) and [Simon Reinhardt](http://simonmreinhardt.tumblr.com/) to put together a comics publication that brings together all the things that I love about comics and independent publishing.

Dog City is a small press comics magazine dedicated to publishing quality minicomics. Each issue of Dog City consists of a curated selection of minicomics packaged in an artfully designed cardboard box.

Issue 1 of Dog City contains over 120 pages of comics in the form of 8 mini-comics by 11 creators from around the world. The box also includes stickers, screen-printed art cards, a poster and a printed magazine about comics and comics culture.

One of the books I'm most excited to be publishing is Pigs Incorporated by [Iris Yan.](http://pigsinmaputo.blogspot.com/) Have a look.[![nfvbaQ3-1](http://fernandezjuanjose.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/nfvbaq3-1.gif)](http://www.dogcitypress.com/post/48028000089/behind-the-scenes-pigs-incorporated-by-iris-yan)As you can imagine, putting something of this scale has been a bonafide labor of love. It's been an honor to be able to service the work of my fellow cartoonists in this production capacity and to present it to the world with the respect it deserves. We're selling this first issue for $15(+$3 for shipping). [You can pre-order copies today.](https://gumroad.com/l/EXZj)

If you'd like to learn more about this project, hop on over to the [Dog City site](http://www.dogcitypress.com/). There'll be loads of posts in the coming weeks, focusing on the production process, artist spotlights and contemporary comics criticism.

<h1>Hello!</h1>

 I'm an artist and full-stack developer who loves teaching comics making and composition.

>This site is the digital confluence of a lot of things I do: comics making, writing, coding, theory-crafting, and teaching. Make yourself comfortable and dig in wherever you like. It's nice to have you here.

<h1>Hello!</h1>

 I'm an artist and full-stack developer who loves Ruby on Rails.

>This site is the digital confluence of a lot of things I do: comics making, writing, coding, theory-crafting, and teaching. Make yourself comfortable and dig in wherever you like. It's nice to have you here.

🧠 I have a deep interest in communication, art, systems design, comics and community development. I love building great applications, solving puzzles, and making people smile. [(Learn more about me)](/about).❤️

🌼 Currently, I'm building a peer-to-peer marketplace platform for zines and self-published comics called [Zine Bloom](https://zinebloom.com/). Ask me about it! I'd love to hear what you think.

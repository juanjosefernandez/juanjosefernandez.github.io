<p>I'm a comics makers whose work centers around love and curiosity while expanding and bending the comics medium with my multidisciplinary background. My comics practice is a mix of drawing, collage, glitching, and copy pasting text and images from the internet and my sketchbooks.<hr>
💐 <i>In a digital world where everything is an ad for sleeker and more high-definition life, I try to sing a beautiful song of pictures and words with the most rudimentary pixel arrangements. 💐</i></p>

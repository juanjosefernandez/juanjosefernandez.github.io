That Box We Sit On by Richie Pope is a little comics miracle. This comic, much like LINK*Super Itis* and LINK*Fatherson*, is a testament to the power of Richie Pope’s imagination. 

*I want to pop open the hood and take a look at what I see going on in this excellent short story.*

## What is it? ##
You’re looking at 16 pages of two friends musing about the box that they’ve come to sit on every day after school. Their theories about it are wild, ranging from a mech slumbering underground or a spatial portal to a sub-dimension to more creepy and silly origin stories. When I found this comic, I found myself in awe of it is a demonstration of Pope’s control as a storyteller.  

With the bare minimum, black lines on white paper, his work shows the strenght of his imagination and the thoroughness  with which he approaches his work intellectually. Top to bottom, every panel counts. All killer, no filler.

## What is it like? ##
This comic is like shooting the breeze with your good bud. You rag on each other, but it’s all good. You don’t have anywhere to be or anything to do. So your imagination runs wild while staying super chill. 
This comic is a breath of fresh air.

## How’s he do it? ##
Aesthetically Pope plays with the power of the binary. 

Like Taiyo Matsumoto’s Black and White in Tekkon Kinkreet, there's beautiful tension of a runaway imagination with a stable, consistenlty chill realness. The character designs make their silhouettes instantly recognizeable. Think Aaron McGruder’s Huey and Riley from his strip, Boondocks, turned down a couple knobs. Hypothesis vs. counterhypothesis. Question vs. Answer.

The down-to-earth, natural, genuine feel of the comic cannot be understated. Pope’s dialogue sounds like bits of conversation I’d hear from the teens hanging out next to my old apartment when I’m coming home. Expertly written and playfully lettered.

Pope’s even handed uniform line allows him to emphasize his spot blacks over any particularly sexy lines. Cartooning in this way allows him to build a visual shorthand throughout this comic and it allows the lines that form the box they sit on to blend, naturally, with the lines that compose the grid. I'm a huge fan of lettering that is an extension of the way that the rest of the page is rendered. It all is of a piece, woven to feel like a cohesive feeling song.

Each of the comic’s sixteen pages contains a single six panel grid. No variance. Using such a prescriptive structure, the work achieves a meditative quality that at once feels tense but supple. Despite the tight structure, it never drones on.

An interesting side-effect of his techinique is that as a reader I find myself asking: Where does this box begin and end? The act of reading becomes a multidimensional experience, where each hypothetical timeline becomes one of many faces on a hypercube. Damn. I applaud Pope for using comics formalism to allow the form of the comic to dance so beautifully in unison with the form of the subject.

## Structural Breakdown: ##

IMAGE GOES HERE FROM PHONE

### What is it? (1 Page) ###
### What it is. (6 pages) ###
These one page postulations…
- Mech
- Bug
- Black World
- Portal
- Aging
- Milk
6 postulations, 6 sides of the box. I love that this sequence can be seen as a narrative cube embedded within the story. 

#### 1 – “It’s a Dog” (2 pages) ####
This sequence touches upon the bogeyman

#### 2 – “Tiny room containing room within rooms.” (2 pages) ####
this sequence hints at infinity

#### 3 – PAUSE (2 pages) ####
 I think the inclusion of this spread is essential in that it allows the reader to feel the space as time, a reminder of the medium of comics and a reminder of the nature of the infinite possibilities of imagination, and the box. It’s the space within the cube.

this sequence presents the present as the experience of infinity, we find ourselves VIVIDLY in the many hypothetical embedded realities

### It is what it is. (2 pages) ###
he crashes it all into a flat possibility, as flat as the page you are reading

### Is it? (1 page) ###

this echoes out the infinite, as you close this book, this reality you ask, is my world just a page in someone’s comic? just a potential parallel reality? FORMAL TRIUMPH -

## So What? ##
Needless to say I love this comic. 

It’s a big deal to see Black kids just shooting the breeze in comics. Inevitably, the politics of allowing your Black characters to hang out and just joke around and eat sunflower seeds is a big deal. Though they’re not being heavily policed, or harmed in the comic the threat of being threatened by armed police is still present. Needless, to say it’s really satisfying to see Black boys afforded some simplicity, a chance to be goofy and carefree in comic.

This comic is quietly glorious in terms of form, content and how it speaks in the context of contemporary America – a comics miracle indeed.



That Box We Sit On testifies to Richie’s imagination, improvisation, and craft. While the characters never physically leave the spot they’re at, they take us across space and time, six panels at a time.

CHANGE THIS:I teach this comic when I work with teens. I teach this comic when I work with adults. 

The reason why I recommend That Box We Sit On onto others, why I'm still writing and thinking about it 2 years after I bought it from Richie is that it's bit of comics magic.  It does what only art can do:

    You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You’re moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You’ve just crossed over into… the Twilight Zone.

The work stays fresh as you never pin down what the box is let alone the “joy” it creates by being the thing it is. Grounded and clever + Abstract and expansive. 

This work is impossibly full of joy and it begs to be shared.

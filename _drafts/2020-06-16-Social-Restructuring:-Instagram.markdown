[think about the images that you'd like to use]

Instagram makes me lonely. 

A qualm I have with how I inevitably experience the world mediated by Instagram is that the user interface hijacks how I would like to relate with my friends. This is a problem, particularly because the global COVID-19 pandemic and its associated quarantines have drastically increased the amount of digital mediation of social relations in our lives. That's not to say this wasn't an issue before, but it's one that is affecting me more than ever. 

The nefarious systems design force that I see at play here is that it causes our relationships to become primarily asynchronous in a shared hyper speed communication space. Ultimately, the knowledge that users who follow each other have of each other enters into weird, uneven information space.

- - - - - - --- -
What do I mean by an uneven information/memory space? Think back to your childhood friends. What did you know about your friend? How did they react when stresses? What kind of jokes did they tell? What was their favorite song? 

How did find this out? All this knowledge was gleaned from mutually shared experiences. Information they explicitly shared with you or maybe information that you just picked up on. On the bus. Working on homework. Walking home. At each others houses. What I want point out here is that your knowledge was in sync with each other due to a shared experience. It was synchronous.

- - - - - -

Social media, particularly Instagram does not work like this. 

It doesn't work like this because all the interactions are asynchronous for the most part. 

You post something in the morning. Your friends and followers see it later, hours or maybe days later. Maybe they see it, maybe they don't. If they do, though, you don't really know when they did, unless they comment or like it. Realistically, if you have more than 200 followers, it becomes hard to track likes as a set of actual interactions with you. Rather they become a lump aggregate of "value" that a certain post accrues. What does that value mean? Well, a lot of things under different circumstances. It's hard to tell. At a basic level it means that X number of people chose to tell you that they saw it and appreciated it. But sometimes people click that button for reasons that actually don't involve you and are more about them, but that requires too long a digression.

Ok, so what effect does all this have on us when we're interacting with other people on the platform? Basically, the User Interface of Instagram welcomes and by design encourages voyeurism. You can observe without necessarily having your observation be observed. Strange. What happens when you’re allowed to be a voyeur? 

For me, this situation creates a unique kind of stunted social longing. This longing stems from a feeling of separation. This separation's origins lie in the fact that Instagram subtly creates a new kind of social relation that embeds itself into our day-to-day life. This social relation is built on seeing our "friends" without being seen. We're here reading and looking at what you've shared but unless we choose for you to see our presence by commenting, liking, or watching a story, you don't know we're there. 

This is the way we relate to public figures and celebrities. The exist in this space that is separate from us. Sometimes we break through the barrier and they become real people with whom we interact with, but for the most part they're just out there. 

What happens when you subject people with whom you were having normally synchronous interactions, to be in asynchronous relationships with each other. Where each needs to keep track of the public utterances (of images, video and writing) that the other person may make?

I don't know exactly. I feel that it creates a hybrid. It does so under the pretense that nothing changes between you and the other person. But things are no longer as they used to.

In a sense, there is a flattening of the gamut of social relations. Suddenly we become especially evident performances of ourselves that may or may not be in sync with the totality of our selves. If you're at all self aware, these spaces end up requiring a whole lot of management of your self-presented self, public self.

The underlying the common usage of instagram is an assumption that this is a digital space of real people sharing real life. This isn't an intentionally virtual place like Second Life TM. Aliases and pen names are not the norm. This is not a stage. And yet, we must act. And we must also be relatively invisible audiences. This is us, we say. Inevitably it's not, though the entire platform is predicated on the idea that it is.

It's a real mind bender and all I can say for sure is that this creates a great deal of pain for me. I feel the presence of a strange social rift. 

When I'm on the app, I feel as if I hate my friends and peers. I resent their lives, lives that I'm not living. Lives that I may not see myself involved in. Why? Outside of this bubble, I wouldn't care. In fact, I'd love to hear a story about what happened when they were with so and so. I've tried to figure out why that is. I don't actually hate them. I resent them not reaching out to me. Why? If I'm not on the app, I don't think of them not thinking of me and I bet they don't think of me not thinking of them at a given instance. We have lives to live and things to do. We think about each other when we think of each other, and that's ok!

So, why do I feel this feeling? This acrid bitterness?

I think it's because I'm feeling a certain kind of pain. It manifests as an anger and cynicism, but it is really rooted in pain and loneliness. The psychological environment on the app is such that if I scroll past my friend I see their avatar and their image is visceral light. It wasn't there 20 minutes ago, so they are here. They are with me. But they're not really. They didn't reach out to me. They just made a public post/story.

I ask myself, why do I feel this way and what can I do about it? Is it because I’m a trash person. Is it that I just don't care about them? What a strange position to be in when the reason that you wanted to hop on this app was feel closer to the world...

I often times  feel I miss them and notice I haven't actually engaged with them in a long while. I ask myself, why haven’t I texted/emailed/message?

These digital spaces, create visceral, yet subtle constant reminders that you are not actually engaging deeply with people. "Yeah, but have you called Luke on the phone?" "When's the last time you talked to Kamryn?" "When was the last time you talked with Camden? Asia?".

Inevitably, the space with its feed of hundreds of images and text breeds a certain kind of social passivity. We can't help it in the face of information overload. This overload is not something that I hear too many people talk about. *Note: If you comment often and message frequently this situation changes. But inevitably, people follow far more people than they actually engage with. As a result, I think what I'm saying is applicable to everyone's relationships on the platform.

-----------

I think that we don't really talk about it is not readily visible. The surface level phenomenon of the App is one of gregariousness and funny posts and people documenting their lives, etc. But the silent majority is scrolling, not posting. So what?

So we feel lonely. And naturally, we seek to remedy it by going to the place where we see the people. The place where we see people's faces everyday. The cycle of appearances of stories in our feeds feels organic and slightly unpredictable. So, it feels alive and full of possibility.

We see people but don't experience people. We're transformed into ghosts due to the design of the platform. And it is miserable.

I want to return to that concept of asynchronous, asymmetric mutual knowledge.

As I said earlier, the problem is that Instagram subtly creates a new kind of social relation that embeds itself into our day-to-day life. This social relation is built on seeing our "friends" without being seen. We're here reading and looking at what you've shared but unless we choose for you to see our presence by commenting, liking, or watching a story, you don't know we're there.

We inevitably have thoughts about our friends our acquaintances, independent of actually engaging with them. Our friends and connections wind up being more in our heads than out in the world.

The worst part happens when we join up with these friends to chat and actually spend time with each other after experiencing each other digitally. Just think about how conversations about something they shared digitally may go. 

We speak as vain ghosts. We communicate with the notion that there is a body of knowledge that folks could know about you. As if you were a celebrity. A public figure. That it's not necessarily your responsibility to update them on whether or not they know about such and such that you shared. You’re both playing this weird game of chicken so as to perhaps not be embarrassed about not knowing about such and such post or story. 

Do they know about such and such or are they just being coy?

At a basic level there's a I've been trying to think about what causes this model mismatch. Get this when we watch someone on social media we are getting shards of content that they produce. Sound familiar? It's comics.

When our model mismatches. Now if you're a digitally native and the majority of your interactions with the world are digital

But it's this 4-dimensional comics reading that maps onto "reality". Thus if we have. The problem here is that inevitably most of our experiences with other people are the people that our minds restructure from the shards of narrative that they've made privy to us.

When Instagram becomes the mutually agreed upon digital portal for creating a virtual self with selected ephemera to acknowledge certain real thoughts or events, strange things arise. 

Again, the reason why I'm writing this is that I believe that relationships become primarily asynchronous and not real time. This may be the FUTURE SHOCK TM shock of it all that I’m feeling, but I feel that it is the design of the platform that causes this.

So is there a way out? All I can offer is that life calling your friends and texting at a leisurely pace without following each other digitally makes for richer, more balanced interactions.

So, off of instagram I've actually been reaching out to people and it is good. My mind's eye is not occupied with thoughts of peoplpe were the relationship of energy is not reciprocated.

For the first time in what feels like a decade, I'm happy with my interactions with people.  The models that I have of people in my head of who these people are find themselves in line with my lived experiences with those people, as opposed to my imagination of who they are. 

What do I enjoy, I enjoy anonymity. I enjoy the feeling of anonymity that you experience moving through a city. I like it when the internet feels this way. I don't mind

I also enjoy intimacy. I enjoy the intimacy of privacy
